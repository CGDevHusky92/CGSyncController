CGSyncController
================

This is the start of new database synchronization library for iOS that will have modular plugins for different web services and protocols to make new ones for custom server set ups. The goal is to generically sync objects that are cached on a device and stored on a server including relationships between objects and even if the relational objects aren't cached yet. Also handle storing only x number of items.
